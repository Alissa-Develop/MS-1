# Milestone 1

This responsive, user-friendly website was created for Infinity, a fictional yoga studio in New York, New York. As the Milestone 1 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Program, this website was built with HTML5, CSS & Bootstrap-4.

The website includes an immediate call-to-action followed by user-testimonials to incentivize new & existing members to sign up. The site also features a class schedule and contact information for users that want to know more about the studio and its approach.

The target market for this website is men & women (18-24) who are currently interested in practicing yoga or who wish to begin practicing yoga.

The website includes positive user testimonials, like this one from current studio member & yoga enthusiast, Octavia Bliss:
