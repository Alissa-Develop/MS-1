# Milestone 1

This responsive, user-friendly website was created for Infinity, a fictional yoga studio in New York, New York. As the Milestone 1 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Program, this website was built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

The website features an attractive jumbotron image with a schedule button that, when clicked, directs the user to the class schedule section of the webpage. The schedule is included to provide class details and information to new & existing members. Infinity’s website also includes user stories, which are a popular trust element in UX, from current yoga students. The user stories on Infinity’s site are included to motivate new & prospective members to sign up and to provide information for those who wish to know more about the studio and its approach.

# UX
This website was built for a fictional yoga studio in Manhattan. The goal of the studio is to attract new members & retain their existing clientbase. 

The target market for this website is men & women (24-36) who currently practice yoga or who wish to begin practicing yoga.

The website includes three positive user stories from current studio members:

> As a yoga student, I am happy that I can find Infinity’s address from any device, so I know where to go!
> - Octavia Bliss

> As a member, I love that I can find class details on Infinity's website, so I know exactly when class is!
> - Daniel Zen

> As an Infinity member, I am happy I can reach out to the studio from their website, so I never have to go out of my way to contact them.
> - Sara Solar

In addition to the final user stories included on the website, user stories were created by the developer during the planning phase of this project: 

> As an Infinity member, I love that I can read more about yoga and meditation on their website, so I know exactly what I'm paying for!
> - Mob Barley, Infinity Member

> As a user, I can navigate the page easily, so I don't get frustrated or confused. 
> - John Doe, Infinity Member

> As a user, I can click a link and move to a different section of the page, so I don't have to scroll around looking for content.
> - Jane Doe, Infinity Member

> As a user, I can tell that I am on a yoga website immediately, so I do not get confused.
> - John Doe, Infinity Member

> As a user, I can navigate back to the top of the page easily, so I don't have to spend time scrolling up!
> - Jane Doe, Infinity Member
