# Milestone 1

This responsive, user-friendly website was created for Infinity, a fictional yoga studio in New York, New York. As the Milestone 1 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Program, this website was built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

The website features an attractive header image with a sign up button and a class schedule to incentivize new & existing members to sign up. The site also includes user stories from current yoga students, for those who wish to know more about the studio and its approach.
